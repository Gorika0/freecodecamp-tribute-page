Hlo everyone,

I'm thrilled to share that i have susscesfully completed my second certification project on freecodecamp-the Tribute Page, which is part of the Responsive Web Design.
This project challenged me to build a fully functional and responsive Tribute Web page using only HTML and CSS.

What i implemented:
*A clean layout with semantic HTML structure.
*A main heading and introductory paragraph.
*An image with proper alt text and responsiveness.
*A timeline or list of key events in the person's life.
*A link to an external source for more information.
*Fully responsive styling using flexbox and media queries.
*Proper use of ID and class selectors to structure content.

Learned from this project:

This wasn't just a coding task - it was a learning experience that taught me-

*How to use semantic HTML tags like <main></main>,<section></section>,and <figure></figure> effectively.
*The importance of accessibilty(using alttext, readable structure).
*How to make content mobile-friendly using responsive units layout techniques.
*How to structure a webpage professionally, with attention to content hierarchy.
*The power of clear, simple design to tell a story effectively.

This project has boosted my confidence in writing clean, maintainable HTML and styling it efficiently with clean, maintainable HTML and styling it efficiently with CSS. Now, I'm even more
exicited for what's next!
